### The Application

The App is a Restaurant/Bakery/Patessiere... registration app, where users can filter for the right conditions, such as whether lactose-free food is prepared, the place is family-friendly, dogs can be brought in, or whether there is free parking. 
They can also see the places on the map, which one is closest to them, or they can also save the given place in a list of favorites.

Other information about the places is also available in the detailed view of the place, such as opening hours, website/phone number, additional photos or reviews.

The backend ensures the management and storage of the data.
